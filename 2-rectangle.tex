% Soft return
This is the first sentence with a soft return.\\   % \\ forces a line break within the same paragraph
This is the second sentence after a hard return.
% Hard return

This is a new paragraph because of a blank line (hard return).   % A blank line creates a new paragraph

% displaying math mode with $[Math eqn]$
This is the famous equation: $E = mc^2$.           % Inline math using single dollar signs

% another example named rectangle
A rectangle has side lengths of $(x+1)$ and $(x+3)$.The equation for ${A(x)=x^2+4x+3}$ gives the area of the rectangle.  
% Parentheses used for values, curly braces for clarity in math

%using \[]\
written in display math

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]
% \[ \] is used for unnumbered display-style math

and
% using \begin{equation}

\begin{equation}
e=mc^2
\end{equation}
% equation environment for numbered display math

and 

$$
{n(n+1)}{2}
$$
% $$ $$ is another way to write display math (unnumbered)
% curly braces here just group expressions, though unnecessary
